This is the repository for *[Image and AIS Data Fusion Technique for Maritime Computer Vision Applications](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2024W/MaCVi/html/Gulsoylu_Image_and_AIS_Data_Fusion_Technique_for_Maritime_Computer_Vision_WACVW_2024_paper.html)*

The dataset cannot be shared as the approval from the institution is pending. Alternatively, you can check this similar and [publicly available dataset](https://fabianholst.github.io/BONK-pose/). BONK-pose dataset provides 2D bounding boxes for object detection, AIS messages, and also 3D bounding boxes for vessel 6D pose estimation.
