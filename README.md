<h2>Dataset</h2>
The AIS data used in this study cannot be shared publicly as the approval from the institution is still pending. However, the images and the 2D bounding box annotations are available for [download here](https://cloud.uni-hamburg.de/public.php/dav/files/iDaLktet82Ld5rb/?accept=zip).

<h2>Alternative Dataset</h2>
If you are looking for a similar and publicly available dataset, you can check out the [BONK-pose](https://fabianholst.github.io/BONK-pose/) dataset. The BONK-pose dataset provides:
<ul>
  <li>3D bounding boxes for vessel 6D pose estimation</li>
  <li>Related AIS data</li>
  <li>2D bounding boxes for ship detection</li>
</ul>
